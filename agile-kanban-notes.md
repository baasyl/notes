# Agile Kanban

- Visualisation tool that enables to optimise the flow of the work.
- Benefits
    - Promote focus
    - Boost productivity
    - Increases visibility
- Goal of Kanban system is to limit work in progress so the work flowing through the system matches its capacity. In other words, a system can only handles so much traffic and still have that traffic moving smoothly through the steps in the process.
- Advanced Kanban board also includes information to help actively manage the way work flows through the board such as like process policies.
- Kanban can start with single team seeking to improve visibility and gain control over workflow and grow from there.
- Kanban systems are simple by design and flexible by nature.
- Kanban concept is at a time when we focus on few items we can move faster.
- Each Kanban board is unique to the team or organisation using it.
- The Kanban board and cards represent a shared visual language that team members and stakeholders can use to quickly communicate high-value information in a way that is frictionless and transparent.


#### Basic elements of Kanban board
- Lanes : represents defined steps in the process
- Cards : represents work items that move through the process


#### Lanes
- Represents steps in the process
- Move from left to right in the lane sequentially
- Horizontal Lanes are also sometimes called swim lanes, can be used to represent processes that happen simultaneously within a team or organisation.


#### Cards
- Each card on Kanban board represents a work item.
- Card’s face/front includes the details that make it easy for everyone on the board to understand the key details of that piece of work such as 
    - Title : What is this work item?
    - Card assignment : Who is working on this card?
    - Card type : What kind of work it is?
    - Due date : Is there defined due date for this work item?
- Within card, includes more in-depth details about work items such as 
    - Card description : What exactly is involved in this work item? What is goal or desired end result?
    - Attachments / Files : Are there any documents, screenshot or visual which is helpful for work item?
    - Comment history : What has team added?
    - Card history

#### Managing flow with Kanban Board
- Process policies are rules or guidelines that the team using Kanban board develops to help the team use the Kanban board consistently.
- Example of process policy: Cards must have a completed project brief attached to the card before moving from “To Do” to “Doing.
- WIP limits : work in progress item limit is defined on how many work items can be in particular land or set of lanes at a particular time. It helps team to avoid overwhelming when too many work item is in progress at once.

#### Kanban vs Scrum boards
- They are same for terminology of Lanes and Cards. Cards move from left to right in each lane sequentially
- Fundamental difference between Kanban and Scrum board is, Scrum boards are designed to be used by the teams operating in time boxed iterations where Kanban is used by team working towards continuous flow.
- In other words, Scrum team use board to “Burn down” all the tasks they have committed to for the particular period of time where as Kanban team uses board to continuously move work through their process.
